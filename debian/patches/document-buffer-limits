+.SH BUFFER LIMITS
+There are 2 limits in
+.I buffer
+affecting the maximum total buffer size: The maximum number of blocks (2048)
+and the maximum size of a block (512kB). This results in a maximum total
+buffer size of 1GB.
+.PP
+
+Note that there is also a kernel limit for the maximum size of a shared
+memory segment (used by
+.I buffer
+internally) which is typically much lower than the limits in
+.IR buffer .
+So if
+.I buffer
+complains about not being able to create a shared memory segment, this limit
+might have to be raised using the command \fBsysctl kernel.shmmax=\fP\fIXXX\fP (see also
+sysctl(1) and proc(5)).

 Internally, for printing purposes, buffer counts in terms of the
 number of kilobytes output.  If the blocksize you use is not a whole
